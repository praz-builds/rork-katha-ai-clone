## 2026-08-15 — Project scaffolding

**Session:** Initial project setup (from Story For My Kid Claude Code session)

### Changes
- Created project at `/Users/mac16/Katha AI/`
- **CLAUDE.md** — project context, architecture, build instructions for Claude Code sessions
- **Supabase schema (migration 00001):** profiles, credit_ledger, stories, chapters, characters, comments, streaks, ad_rewards, referrals — 9 tables with indexes
- **RLS policies (migration 00002):** row-level security for all tables
- **Edge Functions scaffolded:**
  - `generate-story` — full orchestrator (auth, credit deduct, LLM fallback chain, refund on failure)
  - `continue-story` — next chapter generation (author-only)
  - `deduct-credit` — atomic credit deduction endpoint
  - `grant-credit` — AdMob SSV reward verification + 24hr cooldown
  - `library` — paginated curated story feed with genre filter + search
  - `feedback` — comments + one-time feedback credit reward per story
  - `adapty-webhook` — subscription/purchase event handler
- **Shared utilities:** `_shared/credits.ts` (append-only ledger), `_shared/llm.ts` (Sonnet → Haiku → gpt-4o-mini), `_shared/cors.ts`
- **Story generator system prompt v1.0** — `prompts/story-generator.md`
- **Blueprint reference** — copied from Story For My Kid project
- **Strategic decisions doc** — `references/strategic-decisions.md` (product identity, credit economy, growth loops, anti-gaming pipeline, content model, CTA strategy, discovery/feed model)
- **Schema migration 00003** — delta additions from strategic decisions (story_reads, story_followers, user_followers, bookmarks, story_likes, engagement counters, chapter publishing state, language/themes, pending credits, referral chain)
- **Git initialized** with initial commit

### Decisions locked
- App name: **Katha AI — Create Stories**
- Single currency (Credits), no dual coins/gems
- Author-only continuation (readers cannot extend stories)
- AI decides story length (no length picker)
- 3-credit welcome bonus (up from Blueprint's 2)
- Front-loaded creator earnings curve (1 credit/read for first 10, then tapering)
- Full anti-gaming pipeline required for reader earnings
- Genre is single-select; themes are LLM-generated free-form tags
- UI: English + Hindi. Generation: 15 languages

## 2026-08-17 — Rork app review + backend roadmap

**Session:** Full codebase review of Rork-built app (both iOS + Android) against all 12 prompts + fix-up prompt

### Changes
- **ROADMAP.md** — created phased backend execution plan (A through H)
- **CLAUDE.md** — updated architecture section (Rork is native Swift+Kotlin, not React Native), updated build phases, added Rork app status, added new edge functions to TODO list
- **MEMORY.md** — updated with Rork review findings, fix-up list, backend phases
- **build-log.md** — this entry

### Rork App Status
- **Repo:** `praz-builds/rork-katha-ai-clone` (GitHub, private)
- **Original repo** `praz-builds/rork-katha-ai` confirmed safe to delete (clone is strict superset with 16 additional files)
- **iOS:** 40+ screens in Swift/SwiftUI, Literata font bundled, all features in mock mode
- **Android:** Full parity — 40+ screens in Kotlin/Jetpack Compose, same feature set
- **All 12 prompts delivered:** Foundation, Auth, Create Wizard, Series/Continuation, Profiles, Engagement, Search/Bookmarks, Credits/Ads, Fix-up, Analytics, Parental/Language, Streaks/Notifications/Referrals/Offline/Audio

### Review Findings (critical gaps for fix-up prompt)
- Color tokens: nearly every hex deviates from spec (Rork generated own palette)
- Only 12 of 30 seed stories exist; no language field on Story model
- Home screen missing 6 of 8 sections (Continue Reading, For You, Writers You Follow, Rising, Katha's Picks, Welcome-back)
- Reader missing drop cap, progress bar, nav auto-hide
- StoryCard layout is vertical instead of spec's horizontal
- Library has 5 tabs instead of 4
- Author follower counts all wrong
- See MEMORY.md for full list

### Known Backend Bugs Confirmed
- `generate-story/index.ts:137` — double-deduct in response body
- `credits.ts` — race condition (read-then-write, not atomic)
- `llm.ts` — Haiku model ID outdated (Oct 2024 → should be Oct 2025)
- `generate-story` — hardcoded system prompt instead of loading from file

### TODO next session
- [ ] Phase A: Create Supabase project, fix critical bugs, deploy existing functions
- [ ] Phase B: Wire DALL-E 3 + edge-tts into generation pipeline
- [ ] User: Get API keys (Anthropic, OpenAI), create Supabase project
